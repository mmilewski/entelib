Data dumping
==================================================
a) dump whole db content (dump is a json file). indent argument is very important!
./manage.py dumpdata --indent 4  baseapp
./manage.py dumpdata --indent 4  baseapp  >  my_fixture.json

b) dump selected models
./manage.py dumpdata --indent 4 baseapp.UserConfiguration baseapp.Configuration



How to fix small_db fixture?
==================================================

# This task has few steps. It is possible to be done automatically, but can be difficult to write script for that.
# 1) drop groups & perms
python manage.py shell_plus
# then in shell:
Group.objects.all().delete()
Permission.objects.all().delete()
# close shell

# 2) repopulate perms
python manage.py syncdb 


# 3) repopulate groups (and users - they were deleted because of CASCADE)
python manage.py shell_plus
# copy-past from dbfiller.py  PUPULATE GROUPS section (near line 350)
# 'filling configuration' can be omitted


# 4) dump group-permission binding and paste it to small_db.json.
# Also delete old groups data from small_db.json (rather obvious)
python manage.py dumpdata --indent 4 auth.Group
